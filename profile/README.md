For nearly three decades, CSD-CF has been helping clients throughout Stanford with complex, specialized computer needs. We are a full service IT management team, serving a wide range of clientele, from small research labs to entire academic departments, from small groups of workstations to the largest high-performance compute cluster on campus. We've even been known to help out with the odd MRI scanner or robotic car.
